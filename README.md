# Warp Test App Using Vue 3 + Vite

This app assumes that Arlocal is running and that the user has ArConnect.

To use the app, simply press the buttons in order and read the messages.  The latest example creates 2 contracts, one using Warp and one using SmartWeave.  Reads them, then performs the same interaction on each.
