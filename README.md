This app assumes that Arlocal is running.

To use the app, simply press the buttons in order:
1. Create Sample Contracts
Creates part of an AFTR vehicle contract and a PST contract.
2. Read Contracts
Mints tokens for the user on the PST contract, then reads both new contracts and displays them side-by-side.
3. Deposit Tokens
Performs a token deposit from the PST to the AFTR vehicle using internal write.
4. Read PST Contract Again
Shows that the PST contract is now different that the one above.
